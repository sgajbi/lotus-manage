# Operations Runbook

## Important operational checks

- verify readiness and migration posture before trusting supportability endpoints
- confirm canonical host runtime uses port `8001` and ingress identity `manage.dev.lotus`
- treat run-support or workflow lookup failures as persistence or migration issues first
- use repo-native smoke and CI commands before inventing ad hoc runtime checks

## Operational truths

- host/runtime coexistence with `lotus-advise` is part of the service contract
- supportability flows depend on truthful run persistence, lineage, and idempotency history
- capability discovery is backend-owned and should not be inferred by downstream callers
- local Docker keeps PostgreSQL internal to the Compose network by default
